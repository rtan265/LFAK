# [Learn From A Kiwi!](learn-from-a-kiwi.netlify.app)

## What is this project about?

As part of the Startup Weekend Aotearoa (01/05/2020 - 03/05/2020), we contributed to this project by building a MVP for a demo. We built this website in less than 54 hours, using ReactJs. This project will be published at the time of presenting the project, but may be taken down at the conclusion of the event. The live web page is: learnfroma.kiwi

## Description of the project
LearnFromAKiwi is a website that allows users to take classes, and our website aims to give it the "human" aspect of taking class online. 

## How do I run the code?

First, clone the repository. Then navigate into the directory, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then `npm start`, which will open up a local host. Currently, as of (03/05/2020), the only working pages are the landing page, explore timetable page, signin page, and an additional instructor page.
